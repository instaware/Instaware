     About The Elightenment Project

Developed by Thomas Nappo, The Strokefire
project is an effort to improve the modern
RuneScape server environment.

Our biggest aims are performance and clea-
nliness. While the environment will funct-
ion very up to par it will also include an
enormous amount of detailed documentation 
which is also viewable via web browser.

In the end, we hope our contributions tow-
ards a high peforming and cleanly RuneScape
server environment will encourage develop-
ers to also contribute back towards the open
source community.

This project is not related to any specific
company but rather viewed as General Public
material.

By using this product you agree should any
problems arise for whomever, we (developers)
are not responsible.
